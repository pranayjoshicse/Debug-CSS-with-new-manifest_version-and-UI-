# Debug CSS [Add to chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/debug-css/igiofjnckcagmjgdoaakafngegecjnkj?hl=en-US&gl=IN) || [Add to Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pranay-joshi/) || [Add to Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/debug-css/chlajdlkaknpjjgodghbapjhogoigegh)

A lightweight extension for Google chrome and mozilla Firefox to show outline of all the element exist on page.

while working on web page development the one of the difficult part is to position the element as required and check which element affecting the other one.

This chrome & and mozilla Firefox extension allows user to see outline on every element of the page. Hold the keyboard Ctrl button and hover element it will show the element details along with the value.

----------

# Usage

Post installation simply click on the extension icon to turn it On or Off.

If you are a keyboard shortcut lover like me simply hit `Alt+Shift+C ` key to toggle the extension.


----------

# How it works?

This extension works on CSS outline attribute:

add the below code snippet in any CSS of a web page 


`
 Â * {
	outline: 1px solid red;
  }`

The extension does the same the only thing is; it gives different color to different element(s) while the code snippet adds red outline to every element.  

----------

# In Action



- Once installed extension will be listed to the `chrome:\\extension URL` and a small icon will be available next to address bar

To get more detail about any element hold Ctrl key and hover on it, a info bar at the bottom of the page along with a tooltip showing basic style detail of the hovered element will display the bottom bar will show details about the element such as its type (e.g. div, nav, section etc), class(es) applied to it along with its Id.
